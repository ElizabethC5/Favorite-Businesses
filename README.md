My favorite local and other businesses - first time using grid

I had a lot of fun with this learning project in which I listed my favorite local businesses and other businesses. This was my first time using grid, I originally tried using flexbox but just could not get things the way I wanted, grid is better but still not optimal.

I also had to write a lot of code for different screen widths to get the format to adapt with narrower screens, that has worked fairly well too, but also not optimally. I will try a new method perhaps with javascript when I get to it. Thanks for stopping by!
