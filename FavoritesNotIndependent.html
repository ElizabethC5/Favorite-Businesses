            The non-independent businesses that I recommend are located either in the Golden Triangle area of Eustis, Mount Dora and Tavares or the greater Orlando area for now.
          </strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          Why separate out the independent businesses? I believe that small businesses are the backbone of American commerce and I like to support them when I can.

            <strong>Ichiban Chinese and Japanese Buffet</strong><br />
            10301 US-Highway 441<br />

            <br />
            If you have looked at the main page you can tell I like asian stuff. Ichiban is my favorite buffet. I know there is something for everyone in my family whether it be fish, vegetables or American food. Granted their desserts are not spectacular but I like to go there for just about everything else. I have not tried their sushi because I don't like sushi, so I can't say either way whether it is good or not, it costs extra beyond the buffet cost. They also have regular meals on the menu. Some of my favorite dishes are General Tso's Chicken and the Mongolian Beef and they serve fried bananas that are really plantains, which I love.<br />
            <br />
            It is possible to order takeout online for at least $200, though I have never used that feature. The buffet costs about $11 and is great for all you can eat.<br />
            <br />
            When dining out I like to bring my own chopsticks rather than use the disposable wooden ones generally provided. So get those chopsticks out and go for it!

            I like their line of clothing by Vera Wang, but have also bought jeans and other pants there and kitchen appliances. I like their whimsical t-shirts in the men's section that have anything from comic heroes and Looney Tunes to Pusheen. They are the first department store I visit if I want certain items. I recently discovered their men's department, they had nice T-shirts and even a button-up shirt I liked that cost less than if I had bought them in the women's section. I don't like the extremely short sleeves on women's tees. If I have not shaved my underarm hair I can't raise my arms. There are no problems like that with men's or unisex tees.<br />
            <br />
            Their sales are often pretty good and they give out Kohl's dollars that can be used during a certain time period. You get even better deals if you have their card. I pay any cards I have used off before the end of every month so I never have to pay interest. My money really seems to go farther at Kohl's for new items.<br />
            <br />
            When an item is not available in your size, you can check at the store online whether another store has it. If they do, you can buy it and have it sent to you. That is a great feature that got me some must-have items.

            <strong>Aldi</strong><br />
            17495 US Highway 441<br />
            Mt. Dora, FL 32757<br />
            Hours: Mo-Sa 9am-9pm, Su 9am-8pm<br />

            Aldi saves money by not taking everything out of boxes to put on shelves, most items are offered in their boxes. They don't pack the groceries or have disposable bags but offer thicker plastic woven bags for a cost. BYOB - bring your own bags. Sometimes there are empty or nearly empty boxes to use but that makes more trash at home. Also bring a quarter to "rent" the cart, you get it back upon returning the cart.<br />
            <br />
            I was so happy when I found out Aldi was finally coming to Mt. Dora, I used to shop at the Aldis in Leesburg and even The Villages. Somehow I like the one in The Villages best, they always had everything I wanted when I went there. Our local Aldi in Mt. Dora sells out of some things too quickly despite the fact that Walmart is right across the street. I think some people like Aldi because the store is smaller and not as much walking is necessary to shop.<br />
            <br />
            I like the fact that they do offer some European type foods for less money than other vendors, and have foods that others don't have. They even had a relatively cheap ice wine around Christmas 2017 though I was sorry they did not have it at Christmas 2018. I love their German Christmas Lebkuchen and Stollen that otherwise would cost an arm and a leg elsewhere. Their Gluehwein is not badly priced either. They have a selection of wines and beers too, but I don't often find my favorite wines that have the wording, "Qualitaetswein mit Praedikat". These are German wines with no added sugars, no mixing of different grape sorts or wine from different areas is permitted. They also have to be designated one of six types of wine. Such wines can be found at well-stocked stores like Publix or ABC Liquors.<br />
            <br />
            Their prices on regular items like flour, oats, milk and the like are usually cheaper than other stores but do compare prices. They have some seasonal items that are useful too.<br />
            <br />
            I like to make my own muesli, it is cheaper than buying the mixed ones they have and I can use only the ingredients I want. I especially love their dried strawberries that I can't find elsewhere.

            Why would I EVER recommend a car dealership? You usually think of pushy salesmen. Not here. All of their salesmen are polite, even when people like me with a low budget come along. My parents like them too, they are always kind and have offered them solutions for their needs. They have always had a pleasant buying experence there.<br />
            <br />
            I had a car I needed to sell quickly and they bought it from me without me buying one of theirs at the time and without a trade. They paid the difference and even gave me some money back that I sure needed at the time. Later when I needed a used car for my daughter they offered me one of their trade-ins which was in the low price range that I could afford. Other than the price of the car, the fee was $300 which is less than a lot of car dealers these days. I have seen fees for used cars up to $800 which gave me cold feet. I found out that these fees exist because the used car dealers buy them at auction and have to pay the auction fees. <br />
            <br />
            I have also compared their repair fees with other places and they are fair, some smaller repairs they have done for free. They try to pass down every discount of repairs that they get to the customer so that sometimes the repair costs are lower than the estimates.<br />
            <br />
            If you go to buy a new or used car try talking to Junior first although all of the sales personnel are great! They care about their customers. They have a very low turnover rate for their employees, including those in sales, most of them have been there ever since I started doing business with them in 2007 and even before that according to my parents.
