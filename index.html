          <strong>
            Most local independent businesses that I recommend are located either in the Golden Triangle area of Eustis, Mount Dora and Tavares or the greater Orlando area for now.
          </strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          Why separate out the independent businesses? I believe that small businesses are the backbone of American commerce and I like to support them when I can.

            <br />
            I love bubble tea! It may also be called boba tea. The first time I had it was at a small anime convention that does not exist anymore called Florida Anime Experience. That con unfortunately got swallowed up by Megacon Orlando.<br />
            <br />
            At any rate, the best place I have found so far is The Tea Spot at Orlando.<br />
            <br />
            Have a bank or credit card with you, they don't take cash.<br />
            <br />
            After 10 drinks you get one free.<br />
            <br />
            The drink shown in the jar was the customer's own container.<br />
            <br />
            I especially like the rose/green-tea combination or combinations with thai tea. The additions are extra flavors like guava or tapioca balls or pea-sized bubbles filled with juice flavors that pop in your mouth or flavored gel pieces.<br />
            <br />
            The original concept of the bubbles was invented by a top cook that wanted a caviar imitation. The gel pieces are made with agar agar and don't melt in the drinks. Multi-flavor gel bits are available in some asian supermarkets.<br />

            <br />
            I also love ramen! A great place to get it is Sapporo Ramen which is in the same shopping center as The Tea Spot.<br />
            <br />
            They also serve udon noodles and sides like gyoza, a type of Japanese dumpling. They have traditional taiyaki and what was unexpected even German baumkuchen, an exquisite cake that I have associated with Christmastime. I was surprised
            that they have it all year.<br />
            <br />
            They are well known and have been recommended by the local media as well.

            Sunpearl Bakery sells oriental baked goods like mooncake and pastries filled with sweet red bean paste, savory buns, and also some European baked goods like madeleine. There are also hybrids like green-tea cheesecake.<br />
            <br />
            I like a pork and veggie bun they have and love their red bean paste buns.<br />
            <br />
            They also sell good bubble tea too.<br />
            <br />

            There tends to be a rush for the pastries in the early afternoon so get them while you can!

            <strong>A&H Autos</strong><br />

            Hours: by appointment<br />
            <br />
            A&H autos is out of my area but I went there to get a used car and paid cash.<br />
            <br />
            The dealer is just starting out and does not have a lot of cars. He has good quality used cars, they may still need a repair or two but for the price they are not bad.<br />
            <br />
            He does not charge extra fees because he does not get his cars at the auctions, he says their fees are too expensive for him.<br />
            <br />
            I had to go outside the Orlando area to get the cheapest price possible on a 2004 vehicle that still had relatively low mileage and was in decent shape. It is just too expensive for me to buy a used car anywhere near Orlando. I searched for almost two weeks
            and could not find anything decent nearby.<br />
            <br />
            I had called about a car to a dealer at Daytona Beach and he recommended me to his friend at A&H autos because my budget was so low.<br />
            <br />
            It was worth it, A&H Autos is a great find! The car did need a few repairs but nothing major. It is in great shape for a car its age and will tick for quite a while yet.

            Where to start? The restaurant serves some German foods like schnitzel, sauerbraten, fried potatoes, and home made spaetzle! They have a good selection of cold cuts and of course German beer and schnapps. They have live entertainment Thursdays through Sundays, check their <a href="https://docs.wixstatic.com/ugd/4bd62e_b08e1eb878ee4551b0b784e222d44e51.pdf">menu/newsletter</a> for details. <br />
            <br />
            <a href="https://www.facebook.com/truegermandeli/">The Magnolia Square Market deli</a> is well stocked. They serve sandwiches and have a lot of different products from Germany including beer, of course, wines, spirits as well as meats and cheeses and many other products. Some of the cold cuts are made German style in America but taste authentic. At Christmastime they also sell stollen and Christmas chocolate but sold out of my favorite kind of chocolate before Thanksgiving. Those that know German baking won't want to do without vanillinzucker or sahnesteif.<br />
            <br />
            <a href="https://www.hollerbachsoutfitters.com/">Outfitters</a> has traditional German clothing like dirndl and lederhosen. I got a lovely sweater and a beautiful brocade vest and blouse there. I would like to buy more, they have lovely dresses in a rainbow of colors. Looking for a sale is good, traditional German clothing can be expensive.<br />

            I like browsing through their clothing, the prices are great if you like used clothing, sometimes they have very unusual pieces. They also have furniture, linens, books and their costume section sells out by Halloween. I like to cosplay, so finding cheap pieces I can use or adapt is key. I am not saying that other thrift stores in the area are bad, not by any means, but I like the setup of Life Changing Ministries best. Also, I feel better knowing that my money is going toward a Christian cause.<br />

            The place to drop those things off is at The Veteran's Thrift Store at 1614 S. Bay Street in Eustis 32726, Tel: (352) 552-3899. The Veteran's Thrift Store has a lot of different items and occasionally has army uniforms but the clothing is not always as well sorted for quick perusal. Some of their items are a bit expensive for thrift in my honest opinion.<br />

            Get fresh bread and pastries made by a bonafide French baker at this cute shop. The shop used to be just antiques and curios but a number of years ago they added the kitchen and display cases. They also offer imported cheeses and amish jams. He bakes his healthy breads without fat and without additives. My favorites are the walnut-cranberry bread and the black olive bread. His bread tastes authentic. I believe he imports at least some of the ingredients. They also sell their bread at a weekly market but I am not sure where.<br />

            Mom likes the biscotti, I like the chocolate croissants and limoncello cake, my son likes the bear claws with frangipane and my daughter likes the tiramisu cake. Heck, everything is very yummy.<br />

            The location is a little off the beaten path. If you are going north on Highway 19 through Eustis, go all the way through then left at County Road 44 and up a few miles until Grand Island. If coming from Leesburg on Highway 441 take County Road 44 east or if by Lake Square Mall (also called Via Port Mall) take Radio Road and make a right onto County Road 44 East and find the store on your right in about 3 miles or so. It is a pink building.
